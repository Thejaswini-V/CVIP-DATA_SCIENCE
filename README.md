## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a diabetes prediction project. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various features. The dataset used for this project is `diabetes.csv`, which contains information about patients' medical attributes and diabetes status.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `diabetes.csv`, located in the root directory. It is in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format and contains the following columns:

- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant.
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration in 2 hours.
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg / height in m^2).
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).
- `Age`: Age of the patient (years).
- `Outcome`: Target variable (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic).

## Project Structure
- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, data visualization, model building, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the Jupyter Notebook.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions and comments in the notebook to execute each cell and understand the step-by-step process of the project.
5. Experiment with different models, feature engineering techniques, or hyperparameter tuning to improve the prediction performance.
6. You can also deploy the final model for making predictions on new, unseen data.

## Data Visualization
In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find data visualization using various Python libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. These visualizations help in understanding the data distribution, identifying patterns, and analyzing feature relationships.

## Model Building
The project uses several machine learning algorithms for binary classification, such as Logistic Regression.

## Credits
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
